<h4>The Anatomy of a List</h4>
<img src="/images/about/anatomyoflists.gif" alt="A List" />
<p>The above screen shot shows where to find everything in the owners view of a list. Important things to note are:</p>
<ul class="AboutUL">
    <li><b>Lists Navigation</b> - Lists you create will be accessible through this dynamic menu. The top level of the menu
        is all of the list groups you have used, under them are all the lists under each of the list groups.
    <li><b>Special Buttons</b> - Under the lists navigation are the special buttons, where you access the Create & Edit, and Settings
        forms, as well as your List Central Messages.
    <li><b>Permalink</b> - The list name at the top is linked to the permalink to the list. Use this link to share your list externally.</li>
    <li>
        <b>List Actions</b><br />
        <img src="/images/about/actions.gif" alt="A List" /><br />
        In the top right hand corner of the list, there are several buttons that give you access to different
        forms relating to the list: 
        <ul>
            <li>Add list item: where you add new list items, this form is opened by default when a list first loads for the list owner</li>
            <li>Comments: where you can  comment and read other comments </li>
            <li>Tags, where you can add tags to make your list easier to find for both List Central users and search engines like Google</li>
            <li>Edit Lists: where you can change the attributes of the list you specified when you first created the list</li>
            <li>Email List: where you can request to send the list by email to anyone, including yourself</li>
            <li>Delete List:when you are done with a list, delete it with this button</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li><b>Add List Item</b> - Add items to your lists. Use the "List item additions" buttons to include links and/or descriptions with your list
        items. Use the "List item extras" buttons to include one of the available extras with your list item (item from the Amazon 
        product catalog, an image you upload, embedded content like a youtube video, an image from the Creative Commons pool at Flickr).</li>

    <li><b>List Item Actions</b> - Access the pop up edit list item form, and the delete list items button here. If the list item has a link, either 
        to an Amazon product item, or a plain link, the list item name will link out to this url. Otherwise, the list item name is editable 
        via edit in place, which you can read more about below.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>List Ratings</b><br />
<img src="/images/about/rating.gif" alt="List Ratings"  />
The act of rating a list tells List Central, and all of it's members, what you think about that list. List Central enforces that only logged in 
members can rate a list, and you only get one rating per list, however, you can always change your rating. The ratings help determin 
what lists make it to the front page. A high star rating pushes the list's popularity up, while a low rating pushes the list's
popularity down.
