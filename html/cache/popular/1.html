<h1>Welcome to List Central!</h1>

<p>List Central was the creation of Marilyn Burgess, that's me! I wanted to make a cool social network that would 
both be fun, and orderly, thus conquering the world with lists. Well, it didn't really turn out that way for List Central, 
and I lost my momentum for this site. I learned  many things through the process, including how vital a business model is! 
I have since moved on in career. Building List Central from the ground up helped my gain the technical skills and 
experience I needed to get my current, awesome position at <a href="http://sitesell.com">SiteSell</a>, where I work 
from home building tools that enable others to break free of their cubicles.</p>

<p>I will continue to leave List Central up in it's current state, as I love it, and have many bits and pieces 
saved in list form under my account. If you like List Central, keep using it! I apologyze for the lack of progress and 
maintenence that will go into List Central going forward. To learn more about the vision that
was List Central, be sure to stop by the <a href="/about.html">about page</a>.</p>

<p>While I was building List Central, I maintained a blog about the process, and about technical lessons I learns along the way.
I have taken down the List Central blog, and have moved the good quality posts to my personal blog, 
<a href="http://marilynburgess.com">marilynburgess.com</a>. I intend to continue to post about web development there, along with
all the other nifty things in my life I feel like writing about.</p>
